# LC-NMT
Larger-Context Neural Machine Translation

Larger-Context NMT v0.1
===========================

In this version, we introduce a cross-sentence context-aware approach to investigate the influence of historical contextual information on the performance of NMT. If you use the code, please cite <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04347.pdf">our paper</a>:

Installation
------------

LC-NMT is developed by <a href="http://computing.dcu.ie/~lwang/">Longyue Wang</a> and <a href="http://www.zptu.net">Zhaopeng Tu</a>, which is on top of Nematus. It requires Theano0.8 or above version (for the module "scan" used in the trainer).

To install LC-NMT in a multi-user setting

``python setup.py develop --user``

For general installation, simply use

``python setup.py develop``

NOTE: This will install the development version of Theano, if Theano is not currently installed.


How to Run?
--------------------------

1, Pre-processing

We need to process train/dev/test files from common format into historical one. Assume that the number of history sentence is 2 (hist_len = 2).

The orignal format is:

<pre><code>
And of course , we all share the same adaptive imperatives .
We 're all born . We all bring our children into the world .
We go through initiation rites .
We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death , so it shouldn 't surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
</code></pre>

The historical format is:

<pre><code>
NULL@@@@And of course , we all share the same adaptive imperatives .
And of course , we all share the same adaptive imperatives .@@@@We 're all born . We all bring our children into the world .
And of course , we all share the same adaptive imperatives .####We 're all born . We all bring our children into the world .@@@@We go through initiation rites .
We 're all born . We all bring our children into the world .####We go through initiation rites .@@@@We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death , so it shouldn 't surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
</code></pre>
